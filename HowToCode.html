<h1â€ºHow To Code</h1>
<br>
<p>In this website you will learn how to code in HTML. I will go through the basics for beginners.</p>
<br>
<p>This website will teach you how to make a website with a heading and text! Good luck!</p>
<br>
<p>First off you need to write what type of html you are using, we are using the newest version so this is what you type single-pointed brackets (not the words but the actual brackets) around !doctype html.</p>
<br>
<p>Next make a new line in your HTML page and type html with the brackets around it. Repeat step 2 but instead of writing html, write body.</p>
<br>
<p>Now you are going to want to write the link for your website. Start this off on a new line and type a single bracket (the larger side facing to the right) followed by a. Make sure to add a space after a. Then type href which is used to give more information. Then after href put an equals sign and write the link for the website. After the equals sign and at the end of the link to add quotation marks. Then type a single bracket with the larger side facing to the left. Once that is done type /a with brackets around it on the same line.</p>
<br>
<p>Now add a title to your website, so when it is searched up on your browser in the tab section it has a name. You can do this by typing tiltle with brackets around it on a new line then type the name of your website. The name of your website can be anything but it should probably have something to do with your website. Once the heading of your text is typed in (make sure it is next to the title affrimation) type /title with brackets around it.</p>
<p>Now you can add a heading to your website. To do this type h1 with brackets on a new line (the smaller the number the bigger the text) in brackets, type your heading then close it off with /h1 in brackets(use the same number as the start). </p>
<br>
<p>To write the text type p in brackets on a new line then type your text. You can use strong in brackets, type the word, then type /strong in brackets for a bold effect. You can also do the same but instead of typing strong use em. Italics is created by em, em is emphasis.</p>
<br>
<p>You can also type br in brackets to start a new line. Once every paragraph of text is done type /p with brackets around it. (This should also be done before typing br).</p>
<br>
<p>The end is close now. Type /body in brackets on a new line. Then type /html in brackets on a new line too. Now you are done! Congratulations for finishing.</p>
